	\section{Purpose of the Project}
	The purpose of this project is to produce the game designed by the team: Mech-APEX Zero. Mech-APEX Zero is the combination of classical 2D games like Metroid, Castlevania, and Street Fighter. This game will reinvigorate the love for such classics and the modern spin of new combat mechanics will attract new players.

	\subsection{Background}
	The concept of this game was conceived to revitalize a very saturated genre of video games: Platformer. Currently on Steam, new releases of the Platformer Genre has 1167 results. The motivation of the team is to make a game that would stand out amongst the over one thousand competitors. In order to achieve our goal, we have examined the classics and commercial successes to create our project.

	\subsection{Goals}
	The goals of Team Chicken Sausage is to produce an entertaining game to satisfies the needs of our clients. We want our audience to get the enjoyment of playing a platformer and to be dazzled and surprised by our creative story and universe.

	\section{Stakeholders}
	\subsection{Development Team} Prepared by team Chicken and Sausages. Team members: Tian Guo, Saim Zahid, Jonathan Yu, Yicheng Chen and Yanting Zhang. The grades of each student for this course is at stake.
	\subsection{Instructor} Dr. Jacques Carette
	Professor for the Software Engineering (Game Design) capstone course (SE4GP6).  Dr. Carette approves of the project content and final grades. Any requirements that he provides must be accommodated. 
	\subsection{Game Critics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Dr. Jacques Carette -
		Professor for the Software Engineering (Game Design) capstone course (SE4GP6).  Dr. Carette approves of the project content and final grades. Any requirements that he provides must be accommodated.
		\item Daniel Szymczak -
		Teaching assistant for the Software Engineering (Game Design) capstone course(SE4GP6). Mr. Szymczak grades the project content and provides feedback for improvements. He reports directly to Dr. Carette.
		\item Judges for the final demo - Other people or parties that will be judging the final demo of the game.
		

	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{User Participation}
	    Player - The players who enjoy platformers and beat em up games.


	\section{Mandated Constraints}
% 	The game must have a certain degree of complexity attached to it, as required from Dr. Carrete, to gauge the students game development abilities better. This complexity goes hand in hand with the difficulty of developing the game as it is very easy to make tic tac toe compared to a game such as Skyrim.
	\begin{itemize}
	\subsection{Solution Constraints}
	\item Any requirements that Dr. Carette describes must be met. Currently, he has mandated that the game engine must be Unity and Unity Assets are free to use with references.
	\item Any feedback and comments from Mr. Szymczak should be adjust and fix in the next revision.

	\subsection{Implementation Environment of the Current System}
	\item The final product will be able to run on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux systems, as the Unity library allows to build project for all three platforms.
	\item Due to the nature of the game being a combo focused action platformer, control methods such as mouse control or touch screen will not be ideal. The development team will focus its effort on establishing keyboard as the main method of controls. Controllers such as Dualshock 4 and Xbox Controller are options, but do not have plans to implement these currently.

	\subsection{Partner or Collaborative Applications}
	\item The product of this project will comply with all policies of the Unity Free User's Licence Agreement.
	\item This product will not be used for commercial purposes as the assets used were of other Games.

	\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Software}
	\item Unity\\
	Usable as a free license for individual work.

% 	\item Some assets used in this project is created through the use of GIMP. The final product shall comply with GIMP's user agreement.

	\subsection{Schedule Constraints}
	\item The deadline of the Project must be within the 2017-2018 Capstone Course terms. Revision 0 of the product must be completed by December of 2017.

	\subsection{Budget Constraints}
	\item No funding for the project will be provided. Any expenses that occur will be paid individually

	\section{Naming Conventions and Terminology}

	\end{itemize}

	\section{Relevant Facts and Assumptions}
	\subsection{Relevant Facts}

	\begin{itemize}
	    \item As with most games that utilize combos; combos that do more damage will require more keys to be pressed.
	\end{itemize}
	\subsection{Assumptions}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The player meets minimum hardware requirements to run the game.
		\item The player is running the latest version of Windows or Mac OS.
		\item The player is familiar with a mouse and keyboard setup.
		\item The player is able-bodied.
		\item The player has enough dexterity to hit multiple keys in quick succession to perform combos.

	\end{itemize}

	\section{The Scope of the Work}
	\subsection{Existing Inspirations}
	The biggest inspiration for this project is the Metroid and Castlevania franchises. The cohesive aesthetics and level design are areas that this project will attempt to achieve the same level of competence as the classics of this Genre. We want to use the level designs of Castlevania as an inspiration for large levels, hidden corridors, and enemies to contest. The Aesthetic will be near future sci-fi, similar to Metal Slug series, where there are heavy machinery, giant mechanized weapons, but not too advanced in the future. \\
The fighting mechanics of Super Smash Bros Franchise will be used to inspire the combat mechanics of this game to introduce new elements of the old platformer formula.The typical platformer has simplistic combat mechanic such as Super Mario Bros franchise, where jumping on enemies and using items are the only way of dealing direct damage. Castlevania has the "wip attacks" and "spells". Metroid has the arm cannon shots, rockets, and special abilities from the suit. Attacks in this games are simple single button commands. In Super Smash Bros, there are light and heavy attacks paired with directional. Each combination of key presses gives different attack moves. There are also basic attack loops for repeated key presses and charged moves for holding down heavy attacks. We use similar mechanics for our platformer as a way to introduce exciting game play to the player.
	\subsection{Context of the Work}
	Gameplay and level design is the most important aspects of a platformer. Gameplay and combat will be more important for this particular game because of the combat mechanics that is included. We focus a lot of our efforts on refining the gameplay mechanics of the game. We do not have the time to be producing the assets needed for this game, so we will borrow assets from other games that fits our futuristic aesthetic such as Gundam and Megaman. Bugs and feedbacks will be dealt with as much as we can but our main focus will be on the gameplay and level design.

	\end{itemize}
	Schedule subject to change based on progress.

	\section{Risks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The product demands a large portion of time and commitment, once the project has been started, future commitments and opportunity are now lost.
		\item Failure to satisfy any of the functional requirement would cause the game to break and deliver unsatisfactory experience to the player.
		\item Learning to use sprite animator in Unity is one of the most important tool to learn for a 2D sprite based game. The quality of sprite animation can significantly affect the quality of a 2D action game.
		\item The feel of the game play depends heavily on the implementation of sprite animations, movement speed adjustments, and physics. Failure to properly implement these elements would make the game feel clunky to the player.
		\item Failure to design interesting levels will make the game feel bland and sub-par comparing to any other beat em ups.
		\item Developer team attend the same meeting physically due to work and class schedules, 
		\item If the game is a massive hit with the community  there could be potential copyright claims.
		\item if the project isn’t implement up to standard than our course grade will be affected.
		\item the amount of bugs within the game can affect the quality of the game. For details refer to "Bug Impact" section of RevisionPlanRev1.pdf.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Costs}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The entire product will be funded by team. As of now the free version of Unity is being utilized coupled with free, open-source assets. In the future we might have to buy certain assets that fit the theme of the game better. The financial costs will be limited to purchases of assets.
		\item The game should be completed by the end of April 2018. Considering the level design, multiple playable characters, multiple weapons, combo based attacks which require a unique animation the game will take entire alloted time to complete.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{User Documentation and Training}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item User Documentation Requirements.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game will include a user manual outlining all basic movement controls, basic attacks, environment interaction keys, and all combos included in the game. This manual can be accessed by the start menu and the pause menu.
		\end{itemize}
		\item Training Requirements
		\begin{itemize}
			\item The game will be very easy to learn and understand, accordingly we intend for the player to learn as they go. They should be familiar with the the basic movement and attacking commands within the completion of the first level of the game. We encourage player autonomy therefore the player can learn which ever combos they wish to use by looking them up in the user manual. As of now we do not intend to put in a standalone training level before the game actually starts.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Waiting List}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Expansions to the game introducing even more combos.(PUC No.8)
		\item Expansion of the number of levels
		\item Expansion of the number of enemies
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Ideas for Solution}
	Enemy Ai is very large and difficult problem within many games. There are many ways in order to implement the ai within the game and here are some ideas. The first idea, that will apply to many enemies,  is to have  the Ai constantly grab the location of the player’s avatar and a add force in the direction of the player, if the player location is close enough than the enemy should attack. If the enemy is a ranged enemy and  they share the same y coordinate with the player, then the enemy should shoot a bullet in the direction of the player. \\
	The second idea is enemies can have few attacks that can be cycled through against the player. Enemies once within aggression range will move towards the player. Enemy can shoot at the player while moving, and can also start using melee attack cycles when close enough to the player.\\
	The third idea is to have predetermined movement for enemies. Enemies will move in the same direction regardless of the player. \\
