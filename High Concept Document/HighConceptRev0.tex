\subsection*{High Concept}
Take control of the experimental mobile suit weapon as Kyle Braiden. Stop the advances of A.E.U.G. forces and put an end to the worst war in human history yet. Spearhead critical missions to gain valuable intel, cripple enemy operations, while uncovering the truth of Kyle’s past and the origin of his birth.

\subsection*{Overview of Game World}
    \subsubsection*{World}
     Due to the discriminatory policies of The Earth Federation, the space colonies are deprived of their wealth and resources. The outraged citizens of the fringe colonies formed the Anti Earth Union Group and declared war on the Earth Federation. Casualties are in the billions only months after the conflict began.
    Despite the advancement of technology of A.E.U.G., Earth had the advantage in number. A.E.U.G. started the top secret research project: APEX; genetic enhancement research program to mass produce superior combat pilots.
    \subsubsection*{Characters}
    Kyle Braiden: Main character of the game. Raised by foster parents on Earth. Later joined Earth Federation forces to secure benefits for his family. Unbeknownst to him, he is the first successful test subject of APEX program. His unusually high performance is noticed the Federation Forces and is drafted into the Special Weapons Assault Unit.\\\\
    Josephine Schwarz: Villain of the game and mother of Kyle. She is a genius scientist specializes in Gene modification. She is the lead researcher of A.E.U.G.s top secret APEX program. She cares little for anything other than her research. While working with ace pilot Erich Schmitt in order to identify traits that make up the ultimate pilot, she had a relationship with him and became pregnant. She decided to use the unborn Kyle to further her research to the dismay of Erich.\\\\
    Erich Schmitt: Officer and Ace Pilot of A.E.U.G. He is very patriotic with a strong sense of justice. Decided to fight for the cause of A.E.U.G at a young age and has flew over a thousand combat missions. While working with Josephine, he learned of life outside the war and became attached to Josephine’s complete dedication to her research. He was pursuing a serious relationship until he learnt of the existence of of his son Kyle and Josephine’s actions. He ultimately sacrificed himself to secure a normal life for his son.
    
\subsection*{Player Motivation}
The player will be exposed to a brand new sub-genre which combines the simplistic fun of platformers and the exhilarating entertainment fighting games provide. Both of those will be supplemented with RPG elements, giving the player a sense of freedom to carve their own path through the game. The inclusion of combos also significantly raises the skill ceiling of the game attracting a bigger player base. The game could very well be completed using the basic combos but learning and executing the more complex combos will be an exciting challenge for the player; this in turn, coupled with the many playable characters, also increases the replayability of the game. The game will also feature a rich and diverse storyline giving the player an opportunity to really bond with the characters and the history of the game world. 

\subsection*{Genre}

\subsection*{Feature}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A tutorial devised to teach the player how to play through experience rather than text.
        \item There will be ranged  and melee attacks for the players. Ranged attack will do less damage and the weapons have limited bullet clips.  Conversely melee attack will have shorter range but better damage.
        \item The player has 6 different directional moves and 4 different directional moves within the air.
        \item An advanced combo system that allows the player to link his attacks into another as long as his opponent is still within hit-stun. There will be a launcher attack which launches the enemy into the air allowing the player to jump and continue his combo. If the player strings too many of the same attacks the combo will drop, this is to prevent infinite combos. This system will allow many different combos allowing the player to create their attack style.
        \item An advanced movement system with 3 states: walking, dashing and running. During walk stat the player moves at default speed and has complete control of the movement of avatar. Dashing by tapping movement direction twice to dash a short distance at the expense of some boost meter to perform an evasive action. During boost state the avatar can boost vertically upward or horizontally with some deviation based on directional input. This can make avatar reach far distances but only with sufficient boost meter.

        \item Many “puzzle levels”: the secondary experience of the game where the objective is for the player to figure out how to continue given environmental game clues. After the a puzzle level  has been completed for the first time, the level can now be skipped although there will be the standard awards for completing the level. 
    \end{enumerate}
    


\subsection*{Design Goal}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Variable Boss and Level Design: Beating every boss at the end of each level will bring an end to the game.
        \item Rewarding Playing Progression: By finding better weapons and armor or using collected gold/scrap to upgrade existing armor. 
        \item Low Skill Floor: The controls of the player’s avatar will be very simple and intuitive. The player should be able to pick up the control without need to read the instructions.
        \item High Skill Ceiling: The game's combat system will provide the player with many different options allowing the players to express their own play-style. Intricate combos will further raise the skill ceiling.

    \end{itemize}
    
\subsection*{Principal Camera Model}
The main camera model will be fixed player-oriented third person view with the Unity Development Kit. This camera will be used so that player can keep track of the avatar they are controlling, it also requires player a bit of exploring skills to find the items or rewards in hidden areas. It is also convenient for players to fight enemies using different combos, because the camera is focused on the center of the player, so player can see what actions the avatar is taking, and player can check if they pressed the correct keys so they can learn combos and moves very quickly.

\subsection*{Game Conditions}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Winning Condition: Beating every level in the game will result in the completion of the game.

\subsection*{Graphic, Sound and Music Style}
    \subsubsection*{Graphical style}
    This game will have an art style featuring 2D character sprites to mimic the feel of classic action games. The main character’s avatar will be a gundam with more human characteristics and proportions. Enemy characters may be less anthropomorphic. Backgrounds and platforms are Sci-Fi themed to display sceneries of space, futuristic facilities, and military bases.
    \subsubsection*{Sound and Music Style}
    The music will be fast paced rock and roll similar to Dynasty Warrior games to keep players on their toes. The music will also have a techno spin to it to add to the Sci-Fi feel of the game. Other sound in the game include sound of walking/running, hitting, and firing of weapons. For walking, the sound will contain metal clanking and quaking to simulate the step of large machinery. The sound of hitting will include sound of clashing metal for robotic fistfights, and sizzling of laser to simulate use of beam sabers. Firing of automatic ballistic weapons will sound like machine guns. Firing laser weaponry will sound like a zip but much lower and heavier to give impact.
