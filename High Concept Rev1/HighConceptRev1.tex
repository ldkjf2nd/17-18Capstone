\subsection*{High Concept}
Take control of the experimental mobile suit weapon as Kyle Braiden. Stop the advances of A.E.U.G. forces and put an end to the worst war in human history yet. Spearhead critical missions to gain valuable intel, cripple enemy operations, while uncovering the truth of Kyle’s past and the origin of his birth.

\subsection*{Overview of Game World}
    \subsubsection*{World}
     Due to the discriminatory policies of The Earth Federation, the space colonies are deprived of their wealth and resources. The outraged citizens of the fringe colonies formed the Anti Earth Union Group and declared war on the Earth Federation. Casualties are in the billions only months after the conflict began.
    Despite the advancement of technology of A.E.U.G., Earth had the advantage in numbers. A.E.U.G. started the top secret research project: APEX; a genetic enhancement research program to mass produce superior combat pilots.
    \subsubsection*{Characters}
    Kyle Braiden: Main character of the game. Raised by foster parents on Earth. Later joins the Earth Federation forces to secure benefits for his family. Unbeknownst to him, he is the first successful test subject of APEX program. His unusually high performance is noticed by the Federation Forces and is drafted into the Special Weapons Assault Unit.\\\\
    Josephine Schwarz: Villain of the game and mother of Kyle. She is a genius scientist specializing in Gene modification. She is the lead researcher of A.E.U.G.s top secret APEX program. She cares little for anything other than her research. While working with ace pilot Erich Schmitt, in order to identify traits that make up the ultimate pilot, she has a relationship with him and became pregnant. She decided to use the unborn Kyle to further her research to the dismay of Erich.\\\\
    Erich Schmitt: Officer and Ace Pilot of A.E.U.G. He is very patriotic with a strong sense of justice. Decided to fight for the cause of A.E.U.G at a young age and has flew over a thousand combat missions. While working with Josephine, he learned of life outside the war and became attached to Josephine’s complete dedication to her research. He was pursuing a serious relationship until he learns of the existence of his son. He ultimately sacrificed himself to secure a normal life for his son.
    
\subsection*{Player Motivation}
The player will be exposed to a brand new sub-genre which combines the simplistic fun of platformers and the exhilarating entertainment fighting games provide. The inclusion of combos also significantly raises the skill ceiling of the game attracting a bigger player base. The game could very well be completed using the basic combos but learning and executing the more complex combos will be an exciting challenge for the player.\\\\
Most the importantly the player would want to play this game because of the gameplay being fun. The game can be played a variety of ways from casual to hardcore speed runs. The player will be sufficiently challenged and feel accomplished by the end.\\\
 The game will also feature a rich storyline giving the player an opportunity to really bond with the characters and the history of the game world. The player will be compelled to complete the game to find out the hidden past of the main character. \\\\


\subsection*{Genre}
It will be action Plat-former with RPG overtones. Avatar moves through a vertically exaggerated environment, jumping on and off platforms at different heights, while avoiding obstacles and battling enemies.Great demands on players physical skills: reaction time, timing and combo move.

\subsection*{Competitor}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Metroid \\
        Classic Sci-fi side scrolling action platformer playing as Samus the legendary space bounty hunter battling against the parasitic alien race of Metroids. Using the arm cannon and other weapons found throughout the game, defeat all creatures that stands in your way to root out the source of the parasitic outbreak. Game  a large network of side scrolling corridors. Safe points are scattered around the map to act as checkpoints for progression. Sections of the map and secret areas can be unlocked by weapons and upgrades acquired later in the game.

    \end{enumerate}


\subsection*{Feature}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item A tutorial devised to teach the player how to play through experience rather than text.
        \item Well designed level filled with action. Each with their own uniquely designed boss
        \item An advanced combo system that allows the player to link his attacks into another as long as his opponent is still within hit-stun. There will be a launcher attack which launches the enemy into the air allowing the player to jump and continue his combo. If the player strings too many of the same attacks the combo will drop, this is to prevent infinite combos. This system will allow many different combos allowing the player to create their attack style.
        \item An movement system with 2 states: walking and dashing. During walk stat the player moves at default speed and has complete control of the movement of avatar. Dashing by tapping movement direction twice to dash a short distance at the expense of some boost meter to perform an evasive action. During boost state the avatar can boost vertically upward or horizontally with some deviation based on directional input. This can make avatar reach far distances but only with sufficient boost meter.
        \item An advanced item system that allows player's to upgrade their gundam using scrap 
    \end{enumerate}
    


\subsection*{Design Goals}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Level's that feel fun, fair but still challenging
        \item To be stylish. The game isn't about destroying enemy but to style on them through use of combos
        \item Creating Player Progression: the player should feel like they are able to grow their character. 
        \item Simple to pickup but hard to master:  Very simple movement controls that makes the game easy to learn but applying the movements make it hard to master.
        \item Low Skill Floor: The controls of the player's avatar will be very simple and intuitive. The player should be able to pick up the control without need to read the instructions.
        \item High Skill Ceiling: The game's combat system will provide the player with many different options allowing the players to express their own play-style. The play can get by with simple combo's but in order to stylish, intricate combos will further raise the skill ceiling.
        \item Exciting: The game should feel fast and full of action.
    \end{enumerate}



    
\subsection*{Principal Camera Model}
The main camera model will be fixed player-oriented third person view with the Unity Development Kit. This camera will be used so that player can keep track of the avatar they are controlling, it also requires player a bit of exploring skills to find the items or rewards in hidden areas. It is also convenient for players to fight enemies using different combos, because the camera is focused on the center of the player, so player can see what actions the avatar is taking, and player can check if they pressed the correct keys so they can learn combos and moves very quickly.

\subsection*{Game Conditions}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Winning Condition: Beating every level in the game will result in the completion of the game.
        Every level consists of many regular enemies who ultimately lead the player to the boss of the level. Slaying the boss will result in the completion of the level. The entire game is made up of many of the levels consisting of unique enemies and bosses.
        \item Termination Condition: Running out of HP will result in the player dying. 
        The player can lose HP in numerous way which include being attacking by enemies, stepping into environmental hazards such as fire and falling from a high platform. Instant deaths of also present in the game for example falling into a bottomless/fire pit while solving a puzzle.
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Graphic, Sound and Music Style}
    \subsubsection*{Graphical style}
    This game will have an art style featuring 2D character sprites to mimic the feel of classic action games. The main character’s avatar will be a gundam with more human characteristics and proportions. Enemy characters may be less anthropomorphic. Backgrounds and platforms are Sci-Fi themed to display sceneries of space, futuristic facilities, and military bases.\\\\
we chose to implement the visuals of the game in 2D because 2D sprite assets are easier to acquire and implement for 2D platformers. For 3D we would need to find animations of all actions and models, where as we only need to find a 2D sprite sheet and cut the appropriate frames for a character moveset.\\\\
The Sci-Fi, futuristic, and mechanical aesthetic is chosen because the setting of the game takes place in the future with advanced machinery and robotics. We want to add a militaristic feel to it as well because the characters are fighting a war. 
    \subsubsection*{Sound and Music Style}
    Overall we wanted to use music and sound affect that would fit the graphical theme while enhancing the gameplay. We also want to use sound that are somewhat realistic in the context of the game. The music will be fast paced music similar to Dynasty Warrior games to keep players on their toes. The music will also have a techno spin to it to add to the Sci-Fi feel of the game. Other sound in the game include sound of walking, hitting, and firing of weapons. For walking, the sound will contain metal clanking and quaking to simulate the step of large machinery. The sound of hitting will include sound of clashing metal for robotic fistfights, and sizzling of laser to simulate use of beam sabers. Firing of automatic ballistic weapons will sound like machine guns. Firing laser weaponry will sound like a zip but much lower and heavier to give impact.\\\\
    \subsubsection*{Atmosphere}
The atmosphere of this game is tense and serious, as the player's character is fighting a war and trying to uncover his uncertain past. During combat the atmosphere is more lighthearted because the gameplay is a 2D beat-em-up style platforming. However with the context of the games setting, since the player is suppose to be using a highly advanced war machine, able to dispatch enemies like nothing else. It is not completely fun and goofy even during gameplay. 

\subsection*{Target Customer}
Fans of Metroidvania-esque games that also enjoys fighting game elements. Players who like combat systems based off combos (Street Fighter/Tekken, Devil May Cry and Super Smash Bros).
Gamers who prefer RPG elements. The game will be mostly geared towards gamers over the age of 13 because of the ever present fighting elements. 


\subsection*{Target Hardware}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item PC - A bigger screen will allow all the game elements to fit on the screen without feeling cluttered. 
        \item Keyboard - Combos will be better executed using the keyboard, which also allows the developer to introduce complex combos.
        \item Mouse - Will allow for the controls most gamers are used to. Basic attack mapped to the LMB, weapon switching mapped to the mouse wheel.
    \end{enumerate}
