\subsection*{Introduction}
This document contains the road map of changes from revision zero to revision one for the High Concept Document, Requirement Document and Design Document. It also  contains an explination for the given change.
\subsection*{High Concept Road Map}
This section contains a list of changes from revision zero to revision one for the High Concept Document.

\subsection*{High Concept Change Explination}
This section contains a list of changes from revision zero to revision one for the High Concept Document

\subsection*{Requirments Road Map}
This section contains a list of changes from revision zero to revision one for the Requirements Document.\\\\
Regarding requirements 213 and 217, these requirements are added later (hense their requirement number) but belong to the Understandability and Politeness section. Therefore they are located after requirement 204. 
  \begin{enumerate}
        \item Removed irrelevant Mandated constraints
        \item Modified PUC 3 Interacting with Items with Boolean as input (was key input)
        \item Modified PUC 4 Viewing Player and Gear Status to Viewing Player and Status
        \item Modified PUC 19 Interacting with Gundam Gear to Interacting with upgrades
        \item Modified PUC 22 Viewing Achievements to Viewing Progress
        \item Removed PUC 28
        \item Significantly expanded core mechanic Functional Requirements
	 \begin{enumerate}
		\item FR001 and FR002 Requirements for horizontal movement
		\item FR003 and FR004 Requirements for jump action and gravity
		\item FR005 Requirement for upgrade item interaction
		\item FR006, FR007, FR008, FR009, and FR010  Requirements for viewing player status, items, and upgrades
		\item FR011, FR012, and FR013 Requirements for combat actions
		\item FR014 Requirement for damage calculation
		\item FR015 and FR016 Requirements for pausing and unpausing the game
		\item FR017 Requirement for enemy spawning mechanic
		\item FR018 Requirement for level boundary
		\item FR019 and FR020 Requirements for player taking damage and health points
		\item FR021 Requirement for hitboxes
		\item FR022 Requirement for returning to Title
		\item FR023, FR024, and FR025 Requirements for gameplay modes and selection menus
		\item FR026 and FR027 Requirements for pause menu function and layout
		\item FR028, FR029, FR030, FR031, FR032, FR033, and FR034 Requirements for enemy behaviour, enemy health scaling, enemy death and rewards
		\item FR035 and FR036 Requirements for Player death
	\end{enumerate}
        \item Added Security Requirements
        \item Modified Release Requirement to not be as specific and more general
        \item Added additional risks
    \end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Requirments Change Explination}
\begin{itemize}
		\item Change 1: Addressing feedback for Mandated constraints to only include restrictions imposed on the dev team.
		\item Change 2: Only interaction is picking up items, implemented as Boolean check of box collision between avater and item.
		\item Change 3 and 6: Equipment/Gear is removed from the scope for this project
		\item Change 4: Removal of Gear will remove need to interact with Gear, upgrades however are part of the game. Interacted the same way as other items.
		\item Change 5: Achievements is removed from the scope for this project, a menu for viewing achievements is not needed. Player can view progress of game such as how many levels are completed out of the total.
		\item Change 7: Original 8 functional requirements were added upon and expanded to the current 36 to emcompass all necessary actions of the game, and address functions that were missing previously.
		\item Change 8: Addressing feedback. Requirement was missing from Rev 0.
		\item Change 9: Hardware requirements were too specific and arbitrary so we generalized it. Also moved to correct location
		\item Change 10: Modified risk section to indicate priority for implementation and testing.
